# Landing Page Project

## Project 2 for Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

Scroll behavior is achieved through use of native HTML + CSS functionality to preserve accessibility while improving UX.
