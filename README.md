# Landing Page Project

## Project 2 for Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

Would be better to implement scroll behavior through use of native HTML + CSS functionality to preserve accessibility while improving UX, but achieved through JS instead to satisfy project requirements.
